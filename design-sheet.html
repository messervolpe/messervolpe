            <h3>from the Spoon River Anthology</h3>
            <p >I have studied many times <br>
                The marble which was chiseled for me—<br>
                A boat with a furled sail at rest in a harbor.<br>
                In truth it pictures not my destination<br>
                But my life.<br>
                For love was offered me and I shrank from its disillusionment;<br>
                Sorrow knocked at my door, but I was afraid;<br>
                Ambition called to me, but I dreaded the chances.<br>
                Yet all the while I hungered for meaning in my life.<br>
                And now I know that we must lift the sail<br>
                And catch the winds of destiny<br>
                Wherever they drive the boat.<br>
                To put meaning in one’s life may end in madness,<br>
                But life without meaning is the torture<br>
                Of restlessness and vague desire—<br>
                It is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid.</p>
